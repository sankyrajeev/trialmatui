            <Typography variant="body1" className="text-gray-800">
              Knowing your audience is the first step toward product development and marketing. Deeply understanding the problem you’re trying to solve and for whom ensures that you’re targeting a real need in the marketplace, reducing the risk of product-market mismatch.

              Agility and Adaptability
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" className="text-gray-800">
              Startups need to be agile and adaptable to navigate the ever-changing business landscape. Market trends, consumer behavior, and technologies are continually evolving. Being able to pivot or adapt your product quickly can be the difference between success and failure.

              Customer Retention: Not Just Acquisition
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" className="text-gray-800">
              While customer acquisition is crucial, many startups underestimate the value of customer retention. Satisfied, repeat customers not only provide steady revenue but also become brand advocates who can bring in new customers through word-of-mouth.

            {/* Funding and Investment */}

              Strategic Funding and Investment
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" className="text-gray-800">
              Bootstrapping is commendable, but at some point, external funding can propel a startup to new heights. However, it’s vital to find investors who are aligned with your vision and can provide more than just capital, such as valuable networks and mentorship.

            <Typography variant="body1" className="text-gray-800">
              A common mistake startups make is not designing for scalability from the outset. As your customer base grows, your infrastructure and operations need to keep up. Planning for scalability helps prevent logistical nightmares down the road.

              Startup growth is not a straightforward journey; it's more like navigating a labyrinth.
